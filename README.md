# Neural Network from Scratch#

I have successfully implemented the Neural Network from scratch in python.      
**Modules used**: Numpy, Pandas, Maths, Scikit learn.

**Description:** This neural network is able to solve the regression based problems. Three Optimizers have been implemented:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Mini Batch Gradient Descent
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent

Syntax for creaing the model, adding the layers, number of neurons in each layers are almost same. Rectified linear unit (ReLu) activation function has been implemented for solving. 

**Results:** I have used this neural network framework for the time series stock marcket price prediction. The predicted price is quite close to the testing data. Please find the attached jupyter notebbok file for detailed view of the results.
